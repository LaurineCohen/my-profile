         <h2> Sky Diving <i class="fas fa-parachute-box"></i></h2>
         <p> I am passionate about <strong> Extreme Sports. </strong> I wish to focus on my passion and thus find a way to work in the field of extreme sports management and, in parallel with my work, join a professional skydiving team. Being an active sportswoman has always motivated me to explore and keep up to date with sports news. What inspires me most is the way <em> sport makes people happy and dreamy.</em> Athletes are defined by passion and determination, and this very unique way to tell a story is what echoes to me the most. </p>

         <h2> Music <i class="fas fa-music"></i> </h2>
              <p> I am passionate about <strong> Music.   </strong> Listen to it, but especially play it. Indeed, since I was a little girl I have been playing the piano. To be able to interpret the music I love is a joy. I sometimes give lessons and I also play in retirement homes. <em> I think that music is an even more beautiful art when it is shared.</em> </p>

              <h2>Travels <i class="fas fa-globe-europe"></i> </h2>
              <p>I am passionate about <strong> Travelling. </strong> Travelling makes everyone dream... There is nothing more beautiful in my opinion than <em>spending your life discovering cultures and learning from others.</em>  To be able to live incredible experiences by creating memories with people from all over the world... To discover unusual landscapes...  To open your mind to something else... 
              At my young age, I was able to visit more than twenty countries. I am very lucky and  very grateful to my parents for letting me go. I think this is where my open-mindedness and social skills come from, and it helps me every day.  </p>
